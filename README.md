# snowflake-gen
Fusion script that randomly generates snowflake designs.

Clone this repository into your Fusion 360 Scripts folder and run it from the "scripts and add ins" section in Fusion 360 to generate a randomized snowflake shape. Mounting holes to use snowflakes as Christmas ornaments are included and their position can be changed by adjusting the snowflake-gen.py python code. Alternative generation algorithms can be swapped in as desired by changing the generate() function as long as the data structures remain the same. Units are in centimeters unless otherwise indicated.
